# PHOESICS TODOS



** TODO Make store some reference to a color based on index.
Some way that the object retains a reference to it's own color

** TODO Fix whatever broke with the simulation location...Depth pass?
Still not entirely sure what is going on here.

** TODO Try to understand local scaling factor between physics objects and their rendered models...

** TODO Fix camera funkyness when first clicking. You've done this before.

** TODO Go into the imgui git folder, and switch branch to docking, configure accordingly.
